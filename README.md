`mdx-tailor` is a fully typed Markdown to JSX transformer library, designed to empower developers to style Markdown content with custom MDX components üé® and bring it to life as React components. With type inference, flexible configuration, and extended error handling capabilities, `mdx-tailor` enables a seamless and robust developer experience üöÄ.

Works best with Next.js and other React frameworks.

## Features üåü

- **Fully Typed**: Leverage TypeScript for strong typing throughout the library.
- **Configurable**: Easily define your Markdown transformation rules and styles with a comprehensive configuration object.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms, including custom error classes and detailed error logging.
- **Type Inference for Configurations**: No need for verbose type annotations‚Äîenjoy automatic type inference for your configurations.
- **Custom Styling (using TailwindCSS)**: Define styled components for your Markdown elements, providing endless creative possibilities.

## Installation üíæ

Install `mdx-tailor` using npm:

```bash
npm install mdx-tailor
```

Or with bun:

```bash
bun install mdx-tailor
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Import your custom styled components and the `mdxTailor` function, along with your configuration:

```js
import { MDXTailor } from "mdx-tailor";
import components from "./path-to-your-styled-components";
import mdxConfig from "./path-to-your-mdx-config";

const mdx = MDXTailor({ config: mdxConfig, styled_components: components });
```

Use the `getMDXData` method to transform and retrieve your Markdown content as valued JSX elements:

```jsx
function MyMarkdownComponent() {

  const data = mdx.getMDXData("route-defined-in-your-config", "folder-defined-in-your-config","fileName-without-mdx-extension");

  // Now render your Markdown content as JSX!
  return (
    <div>
      {data && (
        <>
          <h1>{data.metadata.title}</h1>
          <h2>{data.metadata.author}</h2>
          {mdx.markdownToJSX(data.content)}
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

folders can be inferred from the route, but for added flexibility, you can use folders from other routes as well. the mdx files need to follow the metadata of your chosen route though.


## Custom Styled Components ‚úíÔ∏è

You can define your own styled components to control how each Markdown element looks. For example:

```jsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

export const components = {
  h1: (props) => <h1 {...props} className={cn("text-xl font-bold", props.className)} />,
  h2: (props) => <h2 {...props} className={cn("text-lg text-red-500 font-bold", props.className)} />,
  // Add more custom styled components...
};

export default components;
```

Now you can import these components and use them with `mdx-tailor` to render your markdown content with custom styles.

## Configuration :gear:

Define your MDX configurations for robust document structure and metadata typing. Below is an example configuration:

```js
const mdxConfig = {
  workDir: "/src/server/mdx",
  // Define your routes with associated metadata
  routes: [
    {
      name: "toolkit",
      path: "/toolkit",
      folder: "/cheatsheet",
      // Define metadata fields for the route
      metadata: [
        { name: "author", type: "string", required: true },
        // ...additional metadata fields
      ],
    },
    // ...additional routes
  ],
};

export default mdxConfig;
```

By utilizing TypeScript, `mdx-tailor` automatically infers the types for provided configurations, ensuring your metadata aligns with the expected types and structure.
